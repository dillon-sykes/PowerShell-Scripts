# Powershell Scripts

A collection of scripts I've created over the years to **administer** and **automate** things. PowerShell scripting with Active Directory, Office 365, Exchange, AutoTask and more.

## Prerequisites

Some of the scripts require additional PowerShell modules to be installed. For example the AutoTask scripts require the AutoTask module to be to be installed. Requirements will also be mentioned in the comments at the start of the script, where they are present.
