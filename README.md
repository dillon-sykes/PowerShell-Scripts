# Powershell Scripts

A collection of scripts I've created over the years to **administer** and **automate** things. PowerShell scripting with Active Directory, Office 365, Exchange, AutoTask and more. Let me know if you have any issues using them, always room for improvement.

## Prerequisites

Some of the scripts require additional PowerShell modules to be installed. For example the AutoTask scripts require the AutoTask module to be installed. Requirements will be mentioned in the notes at the start of each script, where they are present.
